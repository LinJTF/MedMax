Indicate if the change should be split into smaller commits (explain why)\n\n3. Perform a brief code review: check for clarity, structure, and maintainability\n\n4. Check if new logic or code paths have corresponding test coverage\n\n5. Remember that the description should be in English, and should be continous text instead of just bullet points.\n\n6. Finally, remember that you should focus on `why` the change was made, not just `what` was changed since it is already visible in the diff."
